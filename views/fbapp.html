                <p>
                    The game was originally planned to be released as a stand-alone chatbot for Facebook Messenger. However, to be able to fully test the game without having multiple facebook accounts, a web-client was implemented.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The server handles all client connections through the chat. Several structured messages have been implemented to minimize the number of commands the user needs to learn to interact with the game.
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, some commands were implemented in order for users to be able to poll the server for information they might need. All commands are preceded by a '.' to distinguish them from messages that are meant to be sent to other users.
