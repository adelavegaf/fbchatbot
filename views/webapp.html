                    The Web App was built using SocketIO since it provided an easy way to handle client â€“ server communication.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, AngularJS and Angular Material were also used to construct the front end.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, the website is not mobile friendly. Please use the Facebook Messenger App to play through your smartphone.
