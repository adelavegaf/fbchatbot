                    <p>
                        The Web App was built using SocketIO since it provided an easy way to handle client â€“ server communication.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Additionally, AngularJS and Angular Material were also used to construct the front end.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you access the website through a smartphone, you will be prompted to play the game through FB Messenger.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Note that opening the page in several tabs in your browser will effectively register a different player for each tab. This way, if no users are connected, opening 7 tabs will allow you to play the game.

                    <p>
                        All messages that you have received in the game are shown in the chat. Each player has a predetermined color that appears when they speak. Your messages are displayed to the right of the chat panel.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Game status messages are shown in red. They contain useful information about the different events that have happened during the game.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For you to send a message, type in the box at the end of the chat panel and press enter.
                    </p>

                        It consists of two modes: users and roles. You can change between the two modes by clicking on the blue tabs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The leftmost image shows the users mode. During the voting phase and the night phase you can click on the alias of the player who you wish to target.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The rightmost image shows the roles mode. This mode displays the name of each role that is in the game.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Revealed roles show the alias and the avatar of the player that had the role. The roles that have not yet been revealed display an image of a masked avatar.
